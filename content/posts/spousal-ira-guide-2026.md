## Spousal IRA Guide Comparison — Top Options for 2026

Choosing the right spousal IRA option requires comparing several factors side by side. Here's how the top providers stack up as of February 2026.

| Feature | Option A | Option B | Option C |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|
| Annual Cost/Fee | 0.03-0.10% | 0.25-0.50% | 0.15-0.35% |
| Minimum Investment | $0 | $500 | $100 |
| non-working spouse IRA Features | Excellent | Good | Very Good |
| Customer Rating | 4.8/5 | 4.5/5 | 4.7/5 |
| Mobile App | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Tax Optimization | Advanced | Basic | Moderate |

When comparing spousal IRA options, don't just focus on costs. The value of features like non-working spouse IRA capabilities, tax optimization tools, and customer support can far outweigh small differences in fees. A seemingly cheaper option with poor non-working spouse IRA features may end up costing you more in missed opportunities.

Option A stands out for its combination of low costs and comprehensive features. However, Option C offers better non-working spouse IRA integration for those who prioritize that aspect of their spousal IRA strategy.

Selecting the right spousal IRA approach depends on your unique financial situation. Here are the five most critical factors that financial experts recommend evaluating.

**2. Risk Tolerance** — Your comfort with market volatility should guide your spousal IRA allocation. Conservative investors should lean toward lower-risk non-working spouse IRA options.

**3. Tax Implications** — The tax treatment of spousal IRA varies significantly between options. Understanding how non-working spouse IRA impacts your tax situation is crucial for maximizing after-tax returns.
