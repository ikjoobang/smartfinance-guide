| **Premium Costs** | Monthly or annual rates | Must fit your budget | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Deductibles** | Out-of-pocket before coverage kicks in | Affects real-world costs | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Exclusions** | What is NOT covered | Can leave gaps in protection | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Provider Reputation** | Financial strength ratings | Ensures claims get paid | ⭐⭐⭐ |
