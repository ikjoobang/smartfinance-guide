*   **Credit Score Impact:** Applying for multiple loans within a short period can temporarily lower your credit score.
*   **Not Always the Best Option:** **Student loan refinancing** is not always the best option for everyone. If you're struggling to make your current payments or are eligible for loan forgiveness, refinancing may not be the right choice.

Before making a decision, carefully weigh the pros and cons and consider your individual financial circumstances. It's worth exploring if you **should I refinance student loans 2026**, but don't rush the process.

## How Does Student Loan Refinancing Impact My Emergency Fund?

Refinancing your student loans, particularly if it lowers your monthly payments, can free up cash flow that you can then allocate to building or strengthening your emergency fund. Having an [Emergency Fund Guide](/posts/emergency-fund-how-much-2026/) is crucial for financial stability. A lower monthly loan payment means less financial stress and more resources to prepare for unexpected expenses. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average unexpected expense for a household in 2026 is around $1,500. Refinancing your loans can help you better prepare for these situations.
