A single lawsuit can bankrupt an uninsured small business. Yet 67% of small businesses carry insufficient insurance coverage, often because owners don't understand what they need or assume coverage is too expensive.

## Essential Business Insurance Types

### General Liability Insurance
General liability protects against third-party claims of bodily injury, property damage, and advertising injury. If a customer slips in your store or you accidentally damage a client's property, general liability covers legal fees and settlements. Average cost: $30-$60/month for most small businesses. This is the foundation of business insurance — virtually every business needs it.

### Professional Liability (Errors & Omissions)
Professional liability protects service-based businesses against claims of negligence, mistakes, or failure to deliver promised results. If a client sues because your consulting advice caused them financial losses, E&O insurance covers your defense. Essential for consultants, agencies, accountants, real estate agents, and technology companies. Average cost: $50-$100/month.

### Business Owner's Policy (BOP)
A BOP bundles general liability with commercial property insurance at a 15-30% discount compared to buying them separately. It covers your business property, equipment, inventory, and liability in one policy. Most insurers require revenue under $5 million and fewer than 100 employees to qualify. Average cost: $50-$80/month.

## How Much Business Insurance Costs

Most small businesses spend $500-$3,000 per year on insurance, depending on industry, revenue, location, and coverage limits. High-risk industries like construction and healthcare pay more, while home-based online businesses often pay under $500 annually.

Don't skimp on coverage limits. A $1 million general liability policy costs only $10-$15 more per month than a $500,000 policy, but provides double the protection. The marginal cost of higher limits is almost always worth it.
