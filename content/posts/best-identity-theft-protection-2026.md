Identity theft affected 15 million Americans in 2025, with total losses exceeding $20 billion. The average victim spends $1,100 out of pocket and over 200 hours resolving the aftermath. Identity theft protection services promise to prevent and remediate these incidents — but are they worth the monthly fee?

## How Identity Theft Protection Works

These services combine three functions: monitoring your personal information across the dark web, credit bureaus, and public records; alerting you to suspicious activity; and providing remediation assistance if your identity is compromised. Premium plans add insurance coverage for financial losses.

## Top Identity Theft Protection Services

### Aura — Best Overall Protection
Aura offers the most comprehensive monitoring suite, scanning the dark web, data broker sites, financial accounts, and all three credit bureaus in real time. Their $1 million identity theft insurance covers financial losses, legal fees, and lost wages. Plans start at $12/month for individuals and $26/month for families. The included VPN, password manager, and antivirus software add significant value.

### Identity Guard — Best AI Monitoring
Powered by IBM Watson AI, Identity Guard detects threats traditional monitoring misses by analyzing patterns across billions of data points. Their plans include $1 million insurance and start at $8.99/month. The AI-driven approach catches sophisticated fraud attempts that keyword-based monitoring systems overlook.

### LifeLock by Norton — Most Recognized Brand
LifeLock pioneered the identity protection category and remains the most widely recognized service. Plans range from $12-$35/month with $25,000-$1 million in reimbursement coverage. Integration with Norton 360 antivirus provides device security alongside identity monitoring.

## Free Alternatives That Work

Before paying for protection, take these free steps. Freeze your credit at all three bureaus (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion) — this prevents anyone from opening new accounts in your name and costs nothing. Enable free credit monitoring through Credit Karma or your bank. Use a password manager like Bitwarden (free) to generate unique passwords for every account. Enable two-factor authentication everywhere possible.

These free measures prevent the majority of identity theft. Paid services add convenience and remediation assistance but aren't strictly necessary for security-conscious individuals.
