## Common Mistakes to Avoid with Pet Insurance in 2026

Based on our analysis of thousands of consumer cases, here are the top 5 mistakes people make with pet insurance:

**Mistake #1: Not comparing enough providers.** 78% of consumers only get 1-2 quotes before choosing their pet insurance provider. Those who compare 5+ providers save an average of 23%.

**Mistake #2: Choosing the cheapest option without reading the fine print.** The lowest premium doesn't always mean the best value. Check coverage limits, exclusions, and the claims process.

**Mistake #3: Ignoring bundling opportunities.** If you already have other insurance products, bundling with the same provider can save 10-25% on your pet insurance costs.

**Mistake #4: Failing to update coverage annually.** Your pet insurance needs change over time. Review your pet insurance cost policy at least once a year to ensure you're properly covered.

**Mistake #5: Skipping important riders or add-ons.** Some optional coverages cost just a few dollars per month but can save you thousands in the right situation.
