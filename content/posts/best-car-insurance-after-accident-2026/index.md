## Common Car Insurance After Accident Mistakes That Cost You Money

Our consumer research identified the costliest errors people make with car insurance after accident:

**Mistake #1: Only comparing price.** The lowest car insurance after accident premium can hide inadequate coverage that costs you thousands when you actually need your accident forgiveness insurance protection.

**Mistake #2: Not understanding exclusions.** Every car insurance after accident policy has exclusions. Read them before buying — not after you need to file a claim.

**Mistake #3: Ignoring provider financial strength.** A cheap car insurance after accident policy from a financially weak company is worthless if they can't pay claims. Check AM Best and S&P ratings.

**Mistake #4: Over-insuring.** Some consumers buy more accident forgiveness insurance coverage than they need. Right-sizing your car insurance after accident policy can save 15-30% without reducing meaningful protection.

**Mistake #5: Forgetting to update.** Life changes — marriage, children, new home, income growth — should trigger a car insurance after accident policy review.
