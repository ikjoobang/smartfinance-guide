Investing has never been more accessible. In 2026, you can start building wealth with as little as $1, pay zero commissions on stock trades, and access sophisticated portfolio management tools from your phone.

But with dozens of investing apps available, choosing the right one matters. We opened accounts at 12 platforms and tested them over 6 months to find the best options for every type of investor.

## Best Investing Apps Ranked

### Fidelity — Best Overall
Fidelity offers the most complete investing experience with zero-commission trades, fractional shares starting at $1, zero expense ratio index funds, and outstanding research tools. Their mobile app has improved dramatically and now rivals dedicated trading platforms. No account minimums and excellent customer service via phone, chat, and in-person at over 200 investor centers.

### Charles Schwab — Best for All-in-One Banking
Schwab combines investing with checking, savings, and retirement accounts in one platform. Their Schwab Intelligent Portfolios robo-advisor is free for accounts over $5,000, and their stock trading costs zero commissions. The Schwab mobile app handles everything from checking deposits to options trading.

### Robinhood — Best for Beginners
Robinhood's simple interface makes buying your first stock remarkably easy. Zero commissions, fractional shares from $1, and a clean design that doesn't overwhelm new investors. Their 4.5% APY on uninvested cash adds value. However, their research tools and customer support lag behind Fidelity and Schwab.

### Webull — Best for Active Traders
Webull provides advanced charting, technical indicators, and extended hours trading that active traders need. Zero commissions on stocks, ETFs, and options. Their desktop platform rivals professional trading terminals. Paper trading accounts let you practice strategies without risking real money.

### Acorns — Best for Automatic Investing
Acorns rounds up your everyday purchases to the nearest dollar and invests the spare change in diversified ETF portfolios. The $3/month fee includes investing, retirement, and checking accounts. It's the lowest-effort way to build an investment habit, though the fee is proportionally high for small balances.

## What to Consider When Choosing an App

For beginners, simplicity and education matter most. Choose an app with a clean interface, educational resources, and fractional shares so you can start small. Robinhood or Fidelity are excellent starting points.

For serious investors, research quality, fund selection, and tax-loss harvesting tools become important. Fidelity and Schwab excel here with comprehensive research from Morningstar, Reuters, and their own analysts.

For active traders, execution speed, advanced order types, and charting tools are critical. Webull and Interactive Brokers provide the most sophisticated trading tools.

## Getting Started: Your First Investment

If you're new to investing, start with a broad market index fund like the S&P 500 (VOO or FXAIX). This single investment gives you ownership in 500 of America's largest companies, providing instant diversification. Historical returns average 10% annually over long periods.

Set up automatic weekly or monthly contributions, even if it's just $25. Consistency matters more than timing. An investor who contributes $200 monthly for 30 years at 10% average returns accumulates approximately $452,000 — from just $72,000 in total contributions.
