## 5 Essential Factors to Check Before Buying First Time Home Buyer Programs

Before committing to any first time home buyer policy, make sure you evaluate these five critical factors:

**✅ Factor 1: Coverage Limits and What is Actually Covered**
Read the fine print carefully. First time home buyer policies can vary significantly in what they cover. Some policies exclude specific scenarios that you might assume are covered. Always ask for a complete list of exclusions.

**✅ Factor 2: Deductible Structure**
A lower deductible means higher monthly premiums but less out-of-pocket cost when you file a claim. For first time home buyer, the sweet spot is typically a $500 deductible — balancing affordability with reasonable claim costs.

**✅ Factor 3: Claims Process and Settlement Time**
The best first time home buyer provider in the world is worthless if they make claims difficult. Research customer reviews specifically about the claims experience. Look for providers with average settlement times under 14 days.

**✅ Factor 4: Bundle Discounts and Loyalty Rewards**
Many first time home buyer providers offer 10-25% discounts when you bundle with other insurance products. If you already have auto or home insurance, check if your current provider offers competitive first time home buyer rates.

**✅ Factor 5: Financial Stability of the Provider**
Check the provider AM Best rating (aim for A or higher). A financially unstable insurance company may not be able to pay claims when you need them most. This is especially important for first time home buyer since you may not file a claim for years.
