## Common Home Insurance Claim Denied Mistakes That Cost You Money

Our consumer research identified the costliest errors people make with home insurance claim denied:

**Mistake #1: Only comparing price.** The lowest home insurance claim denied premium can hide inadequate coverage that costs you thousands when you actually need your insurance claim appeal protection.

**Mistake #2: Not understanding exclusions.** Every home insurance claim denied policy has exclusions. Read them before buying — not after you need to file a claim.

**Mistake #3: Ignoring provider financial strength.** A cheap home insurance claim denied policy from a financially weak company is worthless if they can't pay claims. Check AM Best and S&P ratings.

**Mistake #4: Over-insuring.** Some consumers buy more insurance claim appeal coverage than they need. Right-sizing your home insurance claim denied policy can save 15-30% without reducing meaningful protection.

**Mistake #5: Forgetting to update.** Life changes — marriage, children, new home, income growth — should trigger a home insurance claim denied policy review.
