## What Is Key Person Insurance and Why Does Your Business Need It?

Key person insurance is a life insurance policy that a business purchases on the life of a critical employee, executive, or owner. The business pays the premiums, owns the policy, and is the beneficiary. If the key person dies or becomes permanently disabled, the business receives the death benefit to cover financial losses during the transition period.

This isn't just about replacing a salary — it's about replacing the irreplaceable. A key person might be responsible for critical client relationships, proprietary knowledge, fundraising ability, or operational leadership that took years to develop.

The financial impact of losing a key person includes:

| Loss Category | Estimated Impact | Duration |
|---|---|---|
| Revenue decline | 20–50% of annual revenue | 6–24 months |
| Recruitment costs | $50K–$250K per executive hire | 3–12 months |
| Training period | Lost productivity during onboarding | 6–18 months |
| Client attrition | 10–30% of key relationships | Immediate |
| Loan covenant risks | Credit line restrictions | Varies |
| Investor confidence | Valuation decrease 15–40% | 6–12 months |

Key person insurance provides immediate capital to weather these disruptions. The death benefit can fund executive search firms, bridge revenue gaps, pay down business debts, or even facilitate an orderly wind-down if necessary.

Common scenarios where key person insurance is essential include small businesses with a dominant founder, tech startups where one developer holds critical IP knowledge, sales-driven companies where a top producer manages major accounts, and any business seeking loans or investment where lenders require key person coverage.

## How Much Key Person Insurance Does Your Business Need?

Calculating the right amount of key person insurance requires quantifying the financial impact of losing that individual. Here are three widely accepted methods used by insurance professionals and financial advisors in 2026.

**Method 1: Multiple of Compensation (Most Common)**
Coverage = 5–10x the key person's total annual compensation (salary + bonus + benefits). A key person earning $200,000 would warrant $1M–$2M in coverage.

**Method 2: Revenue Contribution**
Coverage = the key person's estimated contribution to annual revenue × number of years to replace. If a sales VP generates $3M/year and takes 2 years to replace, coverage should be $6M.

**Method 3: Business Valuation Impact**
Coverage = estimated decrease in business valuation if the person left. If your $10M company would lose 30% of its value, $3M in key person insurance is appropriate.

**Coverage Recommendations by Business Type:**

| Business Type | Key Person | Recommended Coverage | Estimated Premium |
|---|---|---|---|
| Solo consultant | Owner | $500K–$1M | $50–$150/mo |
| Startup (5 employees) | CTO/Founder | $1M–$3M | $100–$400/mo |
| Small business (10–50) | CEO/Top sales | $2M–$5M | $200–$600/mo |
| Mid-size (50–200) | C-suite/Key exec | $5M–$10M | $500–$1,200/mo |

Key person insurance premiums depend heavily on the insured person's age, health, and the coverage amount. A healthy 40-year-old with $1M in term coverage might cost the business only $80–$120 per month — a fraction of the potential financial impact of their loss.

## Key Person Insurance Cost Breakdown — What to Expect in 2026

Key person insurance costs in 2026 vary based on policy type, coverage amount, and the insured person's profile. Here's a detailed cost breakdown to help you budget.

**Monthly Premium Estimates for Key Person Insurance (Term Life, 20-Year):**

| Coverage | Age 35 | Age 45 | Age 55 |
|---|---|---|---|
| $500,000 | $28–$40 | $55–$75 | $130–$175 |
| $1,000,000 | $45–$65 | $95–$130 | $240–$330 |
| $2,000,000 | $80–$115 | $175–$240 | $460–$630 |
| $5,000,000 | $180–$260 | $410–$560 | $1,080–$1,480 |

These premiums represent non-smoker rates for male insureds. Female rates are typically 15–25% lower. Smokers can expect premiums 2–3x higher.

Term life is the most common and cost-effective choice for key person insurance because the coverage need is typically temporary — eventually, the business will diversify beyond dependence on any single individual. However, permanent policies (whole life or universal life) may be appropriate when key person insurance is part of a buy-sell agreement or executive benefits package.

**Tax implications of key person insurance** are straightforward: premiums paid by the business are NOT tax-deductible (per IRC Section 264), but the death benefit received by the business is tax-free (per IRC Section 101). This tax-free payout makes key person insurance particularly efficient as a risk management tool.

## Expert Guide: Implementing Key Person Insurance Step by Step

Setting up key person insurance involves several business and legal considerations beyond simply purchasing a policy. Here's a step-by-step implementation guide used by business insurance professionals.

**Step 1: Identify key persons** — List individuals whose absence would cause significant financial harm. Consider revenue impact, client relationships, operational knowledge, and replaceability.

**Step 2: Quantify the risk** — Use the compensation multiple or revenue contribution method to determine coverage amounts for each key person.

**Step 3: Choose policy type** — Term life for temporary needs (most common), whole or universal life for permanent needs or executive benefit plans.

**Step 4: Obtain consent** — Federal law requires written consent from the insured person. Most employees view key person insurance positively as a sign of their value to the organization.

**Step 5: Apply and underwrite** — The business applies as owner and beneficiary. The key person completes the medical underwriting process (exam or simplified issue depending on coverage amount).

**Step 6: Document the arrangement** — Record the policy in corporate minutes, update buy-sell agreements if applicable, and inform relevant stakeholders (board, investors, lenders).

**Step 7: Review annually** — Reassess coverage needs as the business grows, key persons change, or compensation levels shift. Key person insurance should evolve with your business.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q1. Is key person insurance tax-deductible for the business?**
No. Under IRS rules (IRC Section 264), premiums paid for key person insurance are not tax-deductible because the business is the beneficiary. However, the death benefit is received tax-free under IRC Section 101, making it a net tax advantage.

**Q2. Can the key person also be covered by their own personal life insurance?**
Yes. Key person insurance and personal life insurance are completely separate. The business-owned policy has no impact on the individual's personal coverage or insurability.

**Q3. What happens to the key person insurance if the employee leaves?**
The business has several options: cancel the policy and stop premium payments, transfer ownership to the departing employee (often as part of a separation package), or maintain the policy if the business still has an insurable interest.

**Q4. Do lenders require key person insurance?**
Many SBA lenders and venture capital investors require key person insurance as a condition of funding. Typical requirements range from 1–2x the loan amount or investment. This protects their financial interest in the business.

**Q5. How is key person insurance different from buy-sell insurance?**
Key person insurance benefits the business entity to cover financial losses. Buy-sell insurance funds the purchase of a deceased owner's share by surviving partners or the business. They serve different purposes and are often purchased together.
