Tax season 2026 is here, and you have more options than ever for filing your return. From completely free options to premium software for complex situations, here's how to file accurately without overpaying.

## Free Tax Filing Options

### IRS Free File — Best Truly Free Option
If your adjusted gross income is $84,000 or less, IRS Free File provides access to brand-name tax software at zero cost. Partners include TaxSlayer, TaxAct, and others. Both federal and state returns are free. This is genuinely the best deal in tax preparation.

### Cash App Taxes — Free for Everyone
Formerly Credit Karma Tax, Cash App Taxes offers completely free federal and state filing with no income limits. It supports most tax situations including itemized deductions, investment income, and self-employment income. The interface is clean and mobile-friendly.

### FreeTaxUSA — Free Federal, $14.99 State
FreeTaxUSA has quietly become one of the best values in tax preparation. Federal filing is always free regardless of complexity, and state returns cost just $14.99. It supports all major tax forms and situations.

## Best Paid Tax Software

### TurboTax — Best for Complex Returns
TurboTax remains the market leader with the most polished interface and comprehensive coverage of tax situations. Their interview-style approach walks you through every deduction and credit. Prices range from $69 for Deluxe to $129 for Self-Employed. It's expensive, but the accuracy and ease of use justify the cost for complex situations.

### H&R Block — Best for In-Person Support
H&R Block offers online filing starting at $55 with the option to visit one of 12,000 physical offices if you get stuck. Their AI Tax Assistant answers questions in real time, and their Worry-Free Audit Support provides representation if you're audited.

## Tax Tips for Maximizing Your Refund

Don't leave money on the table. Common overlooked deductions include student loan interest up to $2,500, educator expenses up to $300, state and local tax deductions up to $10,000, and home office deductions for self-employed individuals.

Contributing to a Traditional IRA before the April 15 deadline can reduce your 2025 taxable income by up to $7,000. HSA contributions made before the deadline also reduce taxable income.

If you have children, ensure you claim the Child Tax Credit ($2,000 per child) and the Child and Dependent Care Credit (up to $3,000 for one child or $6,000 for two or more).
