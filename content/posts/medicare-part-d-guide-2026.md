## Medicare Part D Comparison — Key Factors to Consider

When comparing Medicare Part D options, focus on these critical factors rather than price alone. The cheapest option is not always the best value when you consider the total coverage picture.

| Factor | What to Look For | Why It Matters | Priority |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|----------|
| **Coverage Limits** | Maximum payout amounts | Determines actual protection level | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Premium Costs** | Monthly or annual rates | Must fit your budget | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Deductibles** | Out-of-pocket before coverage kicks in | Affects real-world costs | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Exclusions** | What is NOT covered | Can leave gaps in protection | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Provider Reputation** | Financial strength ratings | Ensures claims get paid | ⭐⭐⭐ |

Prescription Drug Coverage plays an important role in the overall value equation. Providers with strong prescription drug coverage options tend to deliver better long-term value, even if their initial premiums are slightly higher.

**✅ Comparison Checklist:**
- ☑️ Get quotes from at least 3 different providers
- ☑️ Read the fine print on exclusions and limitations
- ☑️ Check provider financial strength ratings (A.M. Best, S&P)
- ☑️ Verify the claims process is straightforward
- ☑️ Ask about available discounts and bundling options
