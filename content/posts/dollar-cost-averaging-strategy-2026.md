When comparing dollar cost averaging options, don't just focus on costs. The value of features like DCA investing capabilities, tax optimization tools, and customer support can far outweigh small differences in fees. A seemingly cheaper option with poor DCA investing features may end up costing you more in missed opportunities.

Option A stands out for its combination of low costs and comprehensive features. However, Option C offers better DCA investing integration for those who prioritize that aspect of their dollar cost averaging strategy.
