## Common Homeowners Insurance Companies Mistakes That Cost You Money

Our consumer research identified the costliest errors people make with homeowners insurance companies:

**Mistake #1: Only comparing price.** The lowest homeowners insurance companies premium can hide inadequate coverage that costs you thousands when you actually need your home insurance comparison protection.

**Mistake #2: Not understanding exclusions.** Every homeowners insurance companies policy has exclusions. Read them before buying — not after you need to file a claim.

**Mistake #3: Ignoring provider financial strength.** A cheap homeowners insurance companies policy from a financially weak company is worthless if they can't pay claims. Check AM Best and S&P ratings.

**Mistake #5: Forgetting to update.** Life changes — marriage, children, new home, income growth — should trigger a homeowners insurance companies policy review.
