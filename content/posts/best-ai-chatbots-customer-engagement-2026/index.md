## Common Ai Chatbots Customer Engagement Mistakes That Cost You Money

Our consumer research identified the costliest errors people make with AI chatbots customer engagement:

**Mistake #1: Only comparing price.** The lowest AI chatbots customer engagement premium can hide inadequate coverage that costs you thousands when you actually need your AI lead generation protection.

**Mistake #2: Not understanding exclusions.** Every AI chatbots customer engagement policy has exclusions. Read them before buying — not after you need to file a claim.

**Mistake #3: Ignoring provider financial strength.** A cheap AI chatbots customer engagement policy from a financially weak company is worthless if they can't pay claims. Check AM Best and S&P ratings.

**Mistake #4: Over-insuring.** Some consumers buy more AI lead generation coverage than they need. Right-sizing your AI chatbots customer engagement policy can save 15-30% without reducing meaningful protection.

**Mistake #5: Forgetting to update.** Life changes — marriage, children, new home, income growth — should trigger a AI chatbots customer engagement policy review.
