**Mistake #1: Not comparing enough providers.** 78% of consumers only get 1-2 quotes before choosing their budgeting apps provider. Those who compare 5+ providers save an average of 23%.

**Mistake #2: Choosing the cheapest option without reading the fine print.** The lowest premium doesn't always mean the best value. Check coverage limits, exclusions, and the claims process.
