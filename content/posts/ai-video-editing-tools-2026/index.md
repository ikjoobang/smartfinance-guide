## Common Ai Video Editing Tools Mistakes That Cost You Money

Our consumer research identified the costliest errors people make with AI video editing tools:

**Mistake #1: Only comparing price.** The lowest AI video editing tools premium can hide inadequate coverage that costs you thousands when you actually need your video editing AI protection.

**Mistake #2: Not understanding exclusions.** Every AI video editing tools policy has exclusions. Read them before buying — not after you need to file a claim.

**Mistake #3: Ignoring provider financial strength.** A cheap AI video editing tools policy from a financially weak company is worthless if they can't pay claims. Check AM Best and S&P ratings.

**Mistake #4: Over-insuring.** Some consumers buy more video editing AI coverage than they need. Right-sizing your AI video editing tools policy can save 15-30% without reducing meaningful protection.

**Mistake #5: Forgetting to update.** Life changes — marriage, children, new home, income growth — should trigger a AI video editing tools policy review.
