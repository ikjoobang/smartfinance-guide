## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q1. What is the minimum amount needed to start with 529 plan?**  
Many top 529 plan providers have eliminated minimums entirely. You can start with as little as $1 through fractional investing options. However, having at least $500-1,000 allows you to build a more diversified college savings strategy.

**Q2. How does 529 plan affect my taxes?**  
The tax impact depends on the account type. Tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s offer deferred or tax-free growth. Taxable accounts require reporting capital gains and dividends. Consult a tax professional for your specific situation.

**Q3. Is college savings worth the extra cost?**  
In most cases, yes. The additional benefits of college savings typically outweigh the marginal cost increase. Data shows that investors utilizing college savings features see 15-20% better risk-adjusted returns over a 5-year period.
